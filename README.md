# Computer-Human Interface Scripting Language
CHISL is a scripting language for controlling your device. It harnesses the power of computer vision to dynamically identify and interact with the elements on your screen.

Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/mtalyat/Computer-Human-Interface-Scripting-Language/wiki) for an installation guide, and more.

## Features
- Easy to learn.
- Human readable scripting language.
- Control the keyboard and mouse.
- Identify and act upon elements and text on the screen.
